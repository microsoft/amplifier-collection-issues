# Issues Amplifier Collection

Persistent issue tracking for Amplifier sessions with dependency management and priority-based scheduling.

## What This Provides

- **issue_manager tool** - Create, list, update, and close issues with dependencies
- **issue-aware profile** - Pre-configured session with issue management enabled

## Installation

First, install Amplifier:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier@next
```

Then add this collection:

```bash
amplifier collection add "git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-collection-issues@main
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

Run Amplifier with the issue-aware profile:

```bash
amplifier run --profile amplifier-collection-issues:issue-aware
```

Then interact with issues:

```
You: "Create an issue to implement user authentication"
Assistant: [Creates issue with the issue_manager tool]

You: "What can I work on?"
Assistant: [Lists ready issues with get_ready operation]

You: "Work on issue <id>"
Assistant: [Updates status to in_progress and begins work]
```

### Manual Configuration

Add the tools to your own profile:

```yaml
tools:
  - module: tool-issue
    source: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-collection-issues@main#subdirectory=modules/tool-issue
    config:
      data_dir: .amplifier/issues
      auto_create_dir: true
      actor: assistant
hooks:
  - module: hook-issue-auto-work
    source: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-collection-issues@main#subdirectory=modules/hook-issue-auto-work
    config:
      priority: 100
      max_auto_iterations: 10
      inject_role: system
```

Then add instructions in your profile context similar to what is found in the [example profile](./profiles/issue-aware.md).

## Data Storage

Issues are stored locally in your project:

```
<project-root>/
└── .amplifier/
    └── issues/
        ├── issues.jsonl          # Issue records
        ├── dependencies.jsonl    # Issue relationships
        └── events.jsonl          # Change history
```

This can be configured in your profile (see the Manual Configuration section).
